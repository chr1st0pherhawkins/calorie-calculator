		<h2>About this site</h2>
		<p class="about-section--paragraph">As a fitness enthusiast and personal trainer, I truly believe that fitness should be done scientifically with a goal in mind. Most people do not train as hard as they should do nor pay attention to what they are eating, and then complain when they do not get the results they want. </p>

		<p class="about-section--paragraph">The human body has the potential to do things that most people do believe possible of themselves. As a 13 stone man, I am able to deadlift 440lb, squat 300lb and bench press 264lb. My goal has always been to be as strong and as fit as I possibly can be, and have learnt throughout the way that nothing comes without putting in the effort. In this site I hope to give you as much information as possible on different exercise routines, nutrition, sport spevific exercises, and more to assist you in become as physically primed as you can be.</p>

				<h3>Why do I need Protein</h3>
				<img src="dest/images/protein-icon.png" class="protein-icon">
				<p>Protein is needed for muscle repair and growth. Protein is not stored in the body the same way fat or carbohydrates are. This means that it is either used or discreted from the body. Protein can however be converted to glucose via a process called glcyogenesis if there a lack of carbs or fats in someones diet. </p>

				<h3>Why do I need Carbs</h3>
				<img src="dest/images/carbs-icon.png" class="carbs-icon">
				<p>Carbohydrates are long complex sugar molecules that are required in the body for energy. Unlike the simple sugar molecule which is a singular molecule and either used of converted by the body to fat in a short period. Complex sugars like carbohydrates on the other hand take a long time to break down and is therefore much better for retaining energy over long periods of time. </p>
